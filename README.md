# Exonontom Tech API
The Exonontom Tech API is designed to process Webhook Events from Discord. Currently, the source code is private, as it undergoes continuous development with major changes each day.
The lead developer of this project is `@exonontom on Discord.` If you're interested in contributing, you can contact them directly. Applications for development participation are always open unless announced otherwise, and major updates will be communicated via the Discord server.
# Project Evolution
Originally, Exonontom Tech API was developed to support a Discord bot with the `/bmt (Basic Military Training)` command. This command required a whole number interval argument ranging from 1 to 10,000,000,000 (Roblox User ID). The bot would promote users within a specific Roblox group, shifting them from `rank 12` (Recruit) to `13` (Private)—provided they held the necessary Discord role.
Today, Exonontom Tech API functions primarily as a Discord Webhook Endpoint Handler. All bot-related webhook data from @exonontom is directed to a private endpoint. A public webhook endpoint will soon be available at:
`https://exonontom-tech-api.vercel.io/api/v1/public`
Public webhooks can be sent here, though additional endpoints may be introduced for specific use cases.
