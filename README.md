## Exonontom Tech API
Exonontom Tech API Is designed to receive Webhook Events from Discord, the source code is currently set to Private, as it is still undergoing major development changes every day.
The lead developer of the project is `Discord: @.exonontom`.

If you wish to partake in the development of Exonontom Tech API, contact the Lead Developer, `@.exonontom`.
Applications are always open unless announced otherwise, Exonontom will announce any major changes to the Discord Server.

The ET API was originally developed for the intent of creating a Discord bot with a command `/bmt` (basic military training) which had a required whole number interval argument which ranged in between 1 and 10000000000. (Roblox User ID), the input user ID would've been promoted in a certain Roblox group from rank id `12` (Recruit) to `13` (Private). Although you were required to have a certain Discord role in order to use the command.

Exonontom Tech API is now  a Discord Webhook Endpoint Handler. All of @.exonontom's bot webhooks will be sent to the private webhook url.
The Public endpoint will be sent soon, it will look something like `https://exonontom-tech-api.vercel.io/api/v1/public`. Public webhooks **may** be sent here, otherwise they will be sent to another endpoint.
