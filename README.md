# Exonontom Tech API
## Introduction
The Exonontom Tech API is designed to process Webhook Events from Discord, optimizing real-time data exchange and automating Discord-based applications. The API is currently private, undergoing continuous development with major changes implemented daily.
The lead developer of this project is @exonontom on Discord. If you're interested in contributing, you can contact the Lead Developer. Applications for development participation are open unless announced otherwise, and all major updates will be communicated via the official Discord server.

# Project Evolution
Originally, Exonontom Tech API was developed as an enhancement tool for Discord bots, specifically designed to introduce the /bmt (Basic Military Training) command. This command required a whole number interval argument ranging between 1 and 10,000,000,000 (Roblox User ID). Upon executing this command, the provided User ID would be promoted in a designated Roblox group—shifting the user's rank from 12 (Recruit) to 13 (Private), provided they possessed the necessary Discord role to authorize the action.
Over time, the project evolved, transitioning into a Discord Webhook Endpoint Handler, capable of efficiently managing bot-generated webhook events. Today, all bot-related webhook data from @exonontom is processed through a private endpoint, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability.
A public webhook endpoint will soon be introduced, allowing users to submit webhook events:
`https://exonontom-tech-api.vercel.io/api/v1/public`


Public webhooks may be sent here, though additional endpoints may be introduced for specific custom implementations.

SyncCord Development Team
SyncCord Development is an advanced Discord bot development team, specializing in automation, moderation, and custom integrations. The team has successfully developed and maintains three powerful bots:
- RobloSync – A bot designed to synchronize Discord and Roblox accounts for automation and role management.
- Anti Ghost Ping – Detects and alerts users whenever someone ghost pings them, improving transparency and moderation within Discord servers.
- SecuBot – A security-focused bot that provides anti-raid protection, auto moderation, and server safety features.

Development & Contribution
SyncCord Development welcomes developers, testers, and contributors who are eager to participate in the improvement and expansion of its services. Interested individuals can reach out to the team lead (@exonontom on Discord) for collaboration opportunities.
